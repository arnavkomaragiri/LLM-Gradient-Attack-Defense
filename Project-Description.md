### Topic Area: ###
This senior design project is a research-oriented project focusing on alignment of large language models, specifically under conditions relating to gradient-based postfix attacks on LLMs (ChatGPT, LLaMA, etc.). The current frame of the project specifically targets the class of attacks presented by [Zou et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15043), using ideas from [Bai et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073) to develop countermeasures against attacks on LLMs designed to produce toxic/harmful content. The topic will involve fine-tuning a variety of LLMs with varying model alignment measures, and will analyze the efficacy of each measure in stopping adversarial behavior.
