### Topic Area: ###
This senior design project is a research-oriented project focusing on alignment of large language models, specifically under conditions relating to gradient-based postfix attacks on LLMs (ChatGPT, LLaMA, etc.). The topic will involve fine-tuning a variety of LLMs with varying model alignment measures, and will analyze the efficacy of each measure in stopping adversarial behavior.
