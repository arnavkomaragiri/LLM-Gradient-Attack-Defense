# Professional Biography
**Name: Arnav Chandra Komaragiri**

## Skillsets/Projects Sought
I'm highly passionate about Machine Learning and Deep Learning, specifically with Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Representation. Specifically, I'm quite interested in NLP Alignment, Adversarial Attacks, Multi-Agent Systems, and Semantic Search. Some examples of projects I've worked on in the past that I'd be interested in pursuing are a decentralized semantic search network based on ant-colony optimization, a retrieval-augmented misinformation checker, and various computer vision models. I'm experienced with advanced machine learning, and I bring a diverse set of skills to the table to address any ML/DL workloads encountered.
